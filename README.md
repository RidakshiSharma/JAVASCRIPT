This repository contains three interactive JavaScript mini projects with HTML & CSS:

📝 Live Character Counter

🛍️ Dynamic Product Filter with Dropdown

🎨 SVG Drawing Tool

Each project is self-contained in its own HTML file. Open them in a browser to see them in action.

1️⃣ Live Character Counter

📄 File: live-character-counter.html

✨ Features:

Beautiful animated gradient background.

A styled textarea where users can type.

Displays a live character count (0 / 200).

Includes a progress bar that fills up as you type:

🟢 Green → Safe zone (<70%)

🟠 Orange → Near limit (<100%)

🔴 Red with warning glow → Limit reached (200 chars)

The badge counter animates (bump effect) on every keystroke.

2️⃣ Dynamic Product Filter with Dropdown

📄 File: product-filter.html

✨ Features:

Gradient background with centered product list.

A dropdown menu to filter products by category (Shoes, Shirts, Gadgets, Books, All).

Selecting a category hides unrelated products.

Responsive product cards with hover animations.

3️⃣ SVG Drawing Tool

📄 File: svg-drawing-tool.html

✨ Features:

Interactive white canvas (SVG element).

Draw freehand paths by clicking & dragging.

Each stroke is stored as a separate SVG <path>.
